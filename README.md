### Progression


### Notes
* Very visible sense of progression (often a number total, basically a counter)
* Ways to increase progression (increase counter growth)
* Progression while offline (Idle gameplay)
* Fun gameplay loop!
* Some kind of strategy (decisions for upgrades)
* Barriers that slow down progression and / or make progression non-linear (think bosses or events)
* Microtransactions(?)..I'm a college student
* Remember things are multiplicative!


 
Progression counter: number of armed soldiers. Seeing the village change according to victories.

How to increase progression: leveling the village foragers, adding other smiths to work alongside yourself.

Idle progression: villagers, and other smiths doing their own things.

Strategy: choosing temporary upgrades wisely, choosing when to engage in battle, what weapon molds to use for battle, managing villager population (villagers turn into warriors necessary for battle)

Change in progression: bosses of varying “types”, discovered events, villager events, Separate quests.

Microtransactions: increase numbers, activate special events faster, add permanent counter multipliers.
